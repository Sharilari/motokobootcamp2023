# ðŸ§¹ Task: create the skeleton for the core project.
For your first task, the goal is to **create a skeleton for the core project**. This means that you should have the configuration files set up and the correct structure for your codebase in place. However, this does not include writing any actual code for the project.

The idea is to gather all the different pieces that you will need for the project in one place. This will serve as a starting point for the rest of the work you will do during the week.
To consider your task completed you'll need to have a (locally) running project setup with 3 canisters: 
- A backend canister (Motoko) for managing the logic of your DAO.
- A webpage canister (Motoko) for storing the webpage that your DAO will control.
- A interface canister (Svelte) for the user-friendly interface of your DAO.

You can consider that you've finished the task for today when you have completed the following steps:

1. Copy and take inspiration from this repository that contains a [motoko-svelte-project](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/svelte/svelte-motoko-starter)
3. Add the 3rd canister that we need (webpage). Only add the files you don't need to write any code.
3. Rename the canisters and change the configurations files accordingly.
4. Deploy the project **locally**.
